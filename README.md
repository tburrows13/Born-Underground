# Born-Underground
A platformer game using Python and Pygame

Iniatial commit by Tom Burrows
Jan-July 2016

Python 3; Pygame 1.9.2

### Controls

Left Arrowkey - Move Left

Right Arrowkey - Move Right

Up Arrowkey - Jump

Enter/Return - Reset Level

Escape - Exit

___

It isn't particulary neat but there is a level editor in `main.py` (currently line 602) where you can easily adjust the map

Originally based off platforming example:

Note that due to a problem with pygame, it probably won't be controllable on macOS.
